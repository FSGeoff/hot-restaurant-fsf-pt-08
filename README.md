Views routes
  * home
  * reservation form
  * reservation views
API routes
  * View tables
  * View waitlist
  * Create reservation
  * Clear tables

If view routes return HTML
build out HTML files.

HTML will have: 
  * Boilerplate
  * CSS Library
  * jQuery
  * <h1> Placeholder with the page title


If I have any routes at all, I need to build:
  * Express Server

Version Control and sharing of files.
